*Π: INITIALIZING | Ω: START*

## 🏆 Overview

**Incident Extractor Application** - A serverless AWS-based system for processing and analyzing incident data using AI/ML capabilities. The application leverages AWS Bedrock for LLM vision analysis and provides a multi-stage deployment pipeline for development, staging, and production environments.

## 📋 Requirements

### 🎯 Core Requirements
- [R₁] **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Support for Dev, Staging, and Production environments
- [R₂] **Serverless Architecture**: AWS Lambda-based processing with Step Functions orchestration
- [R₃] **AI/ML Integration**: AWS Bedrock integration for LLM vision analysis
- [R₄] **Data Processing Pipeline**: S3 → Lambda → Step Functions → SQS workflow
- [R₅] **Environment Isolation**: Separate configurations and policies per deployment stage

### 🛡️ Security Requirements
- [R₆] **MFA Authentication**: Required for all AWS operations
- [R₇] **IAM Security**: Least-privilege access policies
- [R₈] **Environment Security**: Progressive security hardening across stages
- [R₉] **Local Testing**: LocalStack validation before AWS deployment

### 🔧 Technical Requirements
- [R₁₀] **Python CDK**: Infrastructure as Code using Python 3.12
- [R₁₁] **Package Management**: uv for dependency management
- [R₁₂] **Container Support**: Docker devcontainer for development
- [R₁₃] **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for observability

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [SC₁] Successful deployment to all three environments
- [SC₂] LocalStack validation of all infrastructure components
- [SC₃] Integration testing of AI/ML workflows
- [SC₄] Performance validation across environment stages
- [SC₅] Security compliance verification

## 📊 Current Status
